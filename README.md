# campuscrowds
Problem Statement: During certain hours in the day it can be difficult to find a place to eat on campus with a limited amount of time. We would like a tool to tell us how crowded a dining location is at any given time.

Mission Statement: At CampusCrowds we are committed to providing a tool to help students save time waiting in lines, promoting a healthy lifestyle by reducing stress and enabling regular eating habits.
